JUDGMENT:
                      J U D G M E N T
Verma, CJI.
     In the present case the fact that certified copy of the
order dated  13.04.92 passed  by the Assistant Collector was
applied by the appellant no 9.5.93, is of no consequence. As
mentioned in the Tribunalâ€™s order it was not in dispute that
the order  dated 13.04.92  was served  upon  the  appellants
herein on  20.04.92 by  delivery of  the same to the counsel
for the  appellants in  the High  Court. That  being so  the
appellants cannot  claim the benefit of the exclusion of the
time taken  for obtaining  a certified  copy thereafter. The
appeal  filed   to  the  Collector  by  the  appellant  was.
therefore, rightly dismissed as time barred on 19.10.95. The
appeal is accordingly, dismissed.
